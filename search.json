A time series model is the joint probability distribution of these variables. In this course, we will study many of the main methods for specifying this distribution: autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models, vector autoregressions (VARs), dynamic linear models (DLMs), hidden Markov models (HMMs), etc. Throughout, we will focus on sequential inference (recursive estimation when the data are streaming) and probabilistic prediction (point, interval, and density forecasting).

If we detect it, you will earn a zero for that part of your write-up.\n\n“Using ChatGPT to complete assignments is like bringing a forklift into the weight room; you will never improve your cognitive fitness that way.” Furthermore, 50% of your final course grade is determined by your performance on old school, no-tech exams.

    "text": "An important consideration in time series analysis is sequential or online inference. In this environment, our data are not available to us all at once in a batch. Instead, the observations are streaming; they are arriving one-after-another in real-time, and we want to come up with a scheme that allows us to recursively update our inferences as new information arrives. Let’s explore this in the context of least squares regression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOLS review\n\n\n\nConsider the usual setting where we observe iid pairs \\(y_i\\in\\mathbb{R}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{x}_i\\in\\mathbb{R}^p\\) from the linear model:\n\\[\ny_i= \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\scriptscriptstyle\\mathsf{T}}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}+\\varepsilon_i,\\quad \\varepsilon_i\\overset{\\text{iid}}{\\sim}\\text{N}(0,\\,\\sigma^2).\n\\] Given \\(n\\) observations, we can form the matrices\n\\[\n\\mathbf{y}_n\n=\n\\underbrace{\n\\begin{bmatrix}\ny_1 \\\\\ny_2 \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\ny_n\n\\end{bmatrix}\n}\n_{n\\times 1}\n\\quad\n\\mathbf{X}_n\n=\n\\underbrace{\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\mathbf{x}_1^{\\scriptscriptstyle\\mathsf{T}} \\\\\n\\mathbf{x}_2^{\\scriptscriptstyle\\mathsf{T}} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\n\\mathbf{x}_n^{\\scriptscriptstyle\\mathsf{T}}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n}_{n\\times p}\n\\quad\n\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_n\n=\n\\underbrace{\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\varepsilon_1 \\\\\n\\varepsilon_2 \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\n\\varepsilon_n\n\\end{bmatrix}\n}\n_{n\\times 1}\n,\n\\] and we can rewrite the model in matrix form:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{y}_n=\\mathbf{X}_n\\boldsymbol{\\beta}+\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_n,\\quad \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_n\\sim\\text{N}_n(\\mathbf{0},\\,\\sigma^2\\mathbf{I}_n).\n\\] The ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator of the regression coefficients is \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_n=(\\mathbf{X}_n^{\\scriptscriptstyle\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{X}_n)^{-1}\\mathbf{X}_n^{\\scriptscriptstyle\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{y}_n.\\)\n\n\nHopefully that was all review, and it describes how to do batch or offline inference for the linear model. We are assuming that all of our data are available in a single batch, and we only need to compute the estimate once. But in our class, we will often care about streaming or online inference: efficiently computing the sequence of estimates \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_1\\), \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_2\\), \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_3\\), … as the pairs \\((\\mathbf{x}_1,\\,y_1)\\), \\((\\mathbf{x}_2,\\,y_2)\\), \\((\\mathbf{x}_3,\\,y_3)\\), … arrive one-after-another in real-time.\n\nSo, imagine we have observed \\(n-1\\) pairs, and we have computed the estimate \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{n-1}=(\\mathbf{X}_{n-1}^{\\scriptscriptstyle\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{X}_{n-1})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}_{n-1}^{\\scriptscriptstyle\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{y}_{n-1}.\\) Then, a new observation \\((\\mathbf{x}_n,\\,y_n)\\) arrives. How can we efficiently update our estimate of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) to incorporate this new information? Of course, we could just add new rows to \\(\\mathbf{X}_{n-1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{y}_{n-1}\\) and recompute the inverse, but that is super inefficient and we can do better. Instead, derive a recursion \\(h\\) that takes the old estimate and the new data and produces the new estimate:\n\n\\[\n\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_n\n=\nh(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{n-1},\\,\\mathbf{x}_n,\\,y_n).\n\\]\n\nWrite a for loop in R that uses your recursion to process a dataset one observation at a time, and verify that at the end of the loop, you get the same estimates that you would have gotten if you had just used lm. Do this for the mtcars dataset and the regression mpg ~ wt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Sherman–Morrison formula is a great tool! For invertible \\(\\mathbf{A}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{p\\times p}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\in\\mathbb{R}^p\\), we have\n\\[\n(\\mathbf{A}+\\mathbf{v}\\mathbf{v}^{\\scriptscriptstyle\\mathsf{T}})^{-1}\n=\n\\mathbf{A}^{-1}\n-\n\\frac{\n\\mathbf{A}^{-1}\n\\mathbf{v}\\mathbf{v}^{\\scriptscriptstyle\\mathsf{T}}\n\\mathbf{A}^{-1}\n}{\n1\n+\n\\mathbf{v}^{\\scriptscriptstyle\\mathsf{T}}\n\\mathbf{A}^{-1}\n\\mathbf{v}\n}\n.\n\\]"

    "text": "Problem X\nAn important consideration in time series analysis is sequential or online inference. In this environment, our data are not available to us all at once in a batch. Instead, the observations are streaming; they are arriving one-after-another in real-time, and we want to come up with a scheme that allows us to recursively update our inferences as new information arrives. Let’s explore this in the context of least squares regression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOLS review\n\n\n\nConsider the usual setting where we observe iid pairs \\(y_i\\in\\mathbb{R}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{x}_i\\in\\mathbb{R}^p\\) from the linear model:\n\\[\ny_i= \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\scriptscriptstyle\\mathsf{T}}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}+\\varepsilon_i,\\quad \\varepsilon_i\\overset{\\text{iid}}{\\sim}\\text{N}(0,\\,\\sigma^2).\n\\] Given \\(n\\) observations, we can form the matrices\n\\[\n\\mathbf{y}_n\n=\n\\underbrace{\n\\begin{bmatrix}\ny_1 \\\\\ny_2 \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\ny_n\n\\end{bmatrix}\n}\n_{n\\times 1}\n\\quad\n\\mathbf{X}_n\n=\n\\underbrace{\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\mathbf{x}_1^{\\scriptscriptstyle\\mathsf{T}} \\\\\n\\mathbf{x}_2^{\\scriptscriptstyle\\mathsf{T}} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\n\\mathbf{x}_n^{\\scriptscriptstyle\\mathsf{T}}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n}_{n\\times p}\n\\quad\n\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_n\n=\n\\underbrace{\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\varepsilon_1 \\\\\n\\varepsilon_2 \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\n\\varepsilon_n\n\\end{bmatrix}\n}\n_{n\\times 1}\n,\n\\] and we can rewrite the model in matrix form:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{y}_n=\\mathbf{X}_n\\boldsymbol{\\beta}+\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_n,\\quad \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_n\\sim\\text{N}_n(\\mathbf{0},\\,\\sigma^2\\mathbf{I}_n).\n\\] The ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator of the regression coefficients is \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_n=(\\mathbf{X}_n^{\\scriptscriptstyle\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{X}_n)^{-1}\\mathbf{X}_n^{\\scriptscriptstyle\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{y}_n.\\)\n\n\nHopefully that was all review, and it describes how to do batch or offline inference for the linear model. We are assuming that all of our data are available in a single batch, and we only need to compute the estimate once. But in our class, we will often care about streaming or online inference: efficiently computing the sequence of estimates \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_1\\), \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_2\\), \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_3\\), … as the pairs \\((\\mathbf{x}_1,\\,y_1)\\), \\((\\mathbf{x}_2,\\,y_2)\\), \\((\\mathbf{x}_3,\\,y_3)\\), … arrive one-after-another in real-time.\n\nSo, imagine we have observed \\(n-1\\) pairs, and we have computed the estimate \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{n-1}=(\\mathbf{X}_{n-1}^{\\scriptscriptstyle\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{X}_{n-1})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}_{n-1}^{\\scriptscriptstyle\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{y}_{n-1}.\\) Then, a new observation \\((\\mathbf{x}_n,\\,y_n)\\) arrives. How can we efficiently update our estimate of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) to incorporate this new information? Of course, we could just add new rows to \\(\\mathbf{X}_{n-1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{y}_{n-1}\\) and recompute the inverse, but that is super inefficient and we can do better. Instead, derive a recursion \\(h\\) that takes the old estimate and the new data and produces the new estimate:\n\n\\[\n\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_n\n=\nh(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{n-1},\\,\\mathbf{x}_n,\\,y_n).\n\\]\n\nWrite a for loop in R that uses your recursion to process a dataset one observation at a time, and verify that at the end of the loop, you get the same estimates that you would have gotten if you had just used lm. Do this for the mtcars dataset and the regression mpg ~ wt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Sherman–Morrison formula is a great tool! For invertible \\(\\mathbf{A}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{p\\times p}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\in\\mathbb{R}^p\\), we have\n\\[\n(\\mathbf{A}+\\mathbf{v}\\mathbf{v}^{\\scriptscriptstyle\\mathsf{T}})^{-1}\n=\n\\mathbf{A}^{-1}\n-\n\\frac{\n\\mathbf{A}^{-1}\n\\mathbf{v}\\mathbf{v}^{\\scriptscriptstyle\\mathsf{T}}\n\\mathbf{A}^{-1}\n}{\n1\n+\n\\mathbf{v}^{\\scriptscriptstyle\\mathsf{T}}\n\\mathbf{A}^{-1}\n\\mathbf{v}\n}\n.\n\\]",

    "text": "The main themes of the course\nWe will focus on the following:\n\n\nIf you understand how to manipulate the multivariate normal, much (most?) of time series analysis is immediately accessible;\nInference should be sequential. We want recursive estimation techniques to handle data that are streaming in real-time;\nPredictions should be probabilistic. We want point, interval, and density forecasts that incorporate many sources of uncertainty;\n\n\n\nAnd there is a secret fourth theme:\n\n\nA Bayesian approach is an excellent way of achieving the goals of sequential inference and probabilistic prediction."
