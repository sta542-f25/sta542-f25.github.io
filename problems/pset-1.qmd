Do some basic AR(2) derivations

derive AR(1) covariance kernel (not assuming stationarity)

do recursive and joint simulations many times and verify that you get the same sample moments.

Bayesian AR(1) with a different prior.

simulation to explore sampling properties when it's a unit root or explosive or whatever.

given the joint, what is the recursion?
