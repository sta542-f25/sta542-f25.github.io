$$
\begin{aligned}
y_t&=\beta_0+\beta_1y_{t-1}+\varepsilon_t,\quad \varepsilon_t\overset{\text{iid}}{\sim}\text{N}(0,\,\sigma^2)\\
y_0&\sim\text{N}(\mu_0,\,\gamma_0)
\end{aligned}
$$

$y_0$ independent of the errors. I don't like the notation for the initial condition variance.

marginal distributions
joint distributions 
conditional (forecast) distributions
stationarity
dependence structure
method of moments (Yule-Walker)
maximum likelihood (unconditional and conditional)
emphasize sequential recursions 
bayesian inference 
probabilistic prediction 
parametric bootstrap 
point prediction 
interval prediction 
density prediction
