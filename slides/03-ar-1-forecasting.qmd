# Recap

## AR(1)

## Joint distribution

## Stationarity 

## Method of moments 

## M(C)LE

## Conjugate Bayes

## Main ideas so far

# Probabilistic forecasting

## Point

## Interval

## Density

## Loss function?

# A classical approach

## It's just the conditional distribution

## Distribution 

## Moments 

## Long run behavior

## Problem: parameters fixed 

## Bootstrap

## Compare intervals

# A Bayesian approach

## Posterior predictive distribution

## One-step-ahead is Student's t

## The rest you can do by simulation

# Application (Inflation?)

## Show them some fucking software?

# Parting thoughts

## Bayes is inherently sequential and inherently probabilistic

# Next time...forecast evaluation!
