## Time series {.medium}

- A [**time series**]{style="color:blue;"} is a set of measurements collected over time;

- We model these data as a sequence of [**dependent**]{style="color:blue;"} random variables:

$$
\By_{0:T} = \{\By_0,\,\By_1,\,\By_2,\,...,\,\By_T\}.
$$

- A [**time series model**]{style="color:blue;"} is "just" their joint probability distribution:

$$
p(\By_{1:T}) = p(\By_0)\prod_{t=1}^Tp(\By_t\,|\,\By_{0:t-1}).
$$
