## Course costs

If you are having difficulty with the costs associated with this course (obtaining a laptop, mostly), here are some resources:

-   [**Karsh Office of Undergraduate Support**](https://financialaid.duke.edu/)**:** Regardless of your aid package, Karsh offers loans and resources for connecting students with campus programs that might help alleviate course costs.

-   [**DukeLIFE**](https://dukelife.duke.edu/programs/course-materials-assistance/)**:** The Course Material Assistance program offers assistance for eligible students, including through the [LIFE Loaner Laptop Program](https://dukelife.duke.edu/academic-support/loaner-laptop-program/). Students who are eligible for DukeLIFE benefits are notified before the start of the semester; program resources are limited.

-   [**Duke Link**](https://link.duke.edu/)**:** They have a small supply of laptops that can be rented out for five days at a time.

## Tech support

Contact the Duke OIT Service Desk at [oit.duke.edu/help](https://oit.duke.edu/help).

## Academic support

There are times you may need help with the class that is beyond what can be provided by the teaching team. In those instances, I encourage you to visit the Academic Resource Center. The [Academic Resource Center (ARC)](https://arc.duke.edu) offers free services to all students during their undergraduate careers at Duke. Services include Learning Consultations, Peer Tutoring and Study Groups, ADHD/LD Coaching, Outreach Workshops, and more. Because learning is a process unique to every individual, they work with each student to discover and develop their own academic strategy for success at Duke. Contact the ARC to schedule an appointment. Undergraduates in any year, studying any discipline can benefit! Contact [ARC\@duke.edu](mailto:arc@duke.edu), 919-684-5917.

## Accessibility

If any portion of the course is not accessible to you due to challenges with technology or the course format, please let me know so we can make appropriate accommodations.

The [Student Disability Access Office (SDAO)](https://access.duke.edu/students) is available to ensure that students can engage with their courses and related assignments. Students should contact the SDAO to [request or update accommodations](https://access.duke.edu/requests) under these circumstances.
