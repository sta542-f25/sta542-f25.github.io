## Textbooks

You are not required to purchase a textbook for this class. I strive to make the lectures self-contained and sufficient for all of the assignments. However, if you wish to follow along with one, these are all good options:

-   `[Ross]` *A First Course in Probability* by Sheldon Ross;
-   `[HTZ]` *Probability and Statistical Inference* by Robert Hogg, Elliot Tanis, and Dale Zimmerman;
-   `[DS]` *Probability and Statistics* by Morris Degroot and Mark Schervish;
-   `[Wass]` *All of Statistics* by Larry Wasserman.

In the **PREPARE** column of the [course schedule](https://sta240-s25.github.io/), I will indicate which parts of a book correspond to the lectures.

## Technology

Lecture will largely be a low tech affair: pencil and paper should be sufficient most of the time. You should plan to bring a laptop or tablet device to lab. In general, you will need access to a device with internet so that you can use the following:

-   [This course page](https://sta240-s25.github.io/) that you are on right now;
-   `R`/`RStudio` via the [Duke Container Manager](https://cmgr.oit.duke.edu/containers);
-   [Canvas](https://go.canvas.duke.edu/), through which you can access...
    -   [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/944220);
    -   [Ed Discussion](https://edstem.org/us/courses/71371/discussion);
-   [Zoom](https://duke.zoom.us/) (e.g. for remote office hours).

If access to technology becomes a concern for you during the semester, contact the instructor immediately to discuss options.
