## Description

We will spend roughly two thirds of the course on probability theory, and the last third on mathematical statistics. In **probability**, we describe the distribution of a random phenomenon and then study how the realizations of that phenomenon behave. In **statistics**, we do the reverse; we start with the realizations of a random phenomenon, and then try to figure out what distribution generated them. In this course, we will:

-   learn how to model random phenomena using a probability distribution, and learn how to extract from that distribution features and summaries that describe the phenomena's "average" or "typical" behavior;

-   learn the mathematics necessary to pose and answer questions like: does this statistical procedure work? what does it mean for it to work? when does it work? how well does it work?

-   write computer simulations to demonstrate the theoretical properties of probability distributions and statistical procedures;

-   learn how to analyze small, stylized datasets.

**Prerequisites:** single-variable calculus.
