title: "Course overview"
---

**Class meeting**: MoWe 11:45 AM - 1:00 PM in Old Chem 201;

**Description**: This is an introductory course in time series analysis with a focus on applications. Two basic approaches, including time domain and ~~frequency domain methods~~, will be covered. A modern time-frequency analysis approach to study nonstationary time series analysis will also be introduced. The main goal is to guide the students to appreciate the main issues involved in time series analysis and solve practical challenges, ~~particularly those coming from the high-frequency and ultra-long biomedical time series~~. The primary audience for this course is graduate students in statistics;

**Prerequisite**: STA 521; **Corequisite**: STA 532.

## Textbooks

The course does not have a designated textbook, and you are not required to purchase anything, but here are several you should know about:

## Assignments and grading

The course consists of the following components:

- There will be 5 - 6 problems sets due roughly every two weeks;
- There will be two in-class, pencil-and-paper exams. The only resource you are allowed is both sides of one 8.5" x 11" sheet of notes prepared by you;
- The course will conclude with a final project where each student writes a report that applies or extends ideas from the course. Full details about the project will be announced later in the semester.

These components will be weighted like this:

::: {.center-table}
| Category     | Percentage |
|--------------|------------|
| Problem Sets | 25%        |
| Exam 1       | 25%        |
| Exam 2       | 25%        |
| Project      | 25%        |
:::

Your final letter grade will be determined based on the usual thresholds, which will never move upward but may move downward in your favor:

::: {.center-table}
| Letter Grade | Final Course Grade |
|--------------|--------------------|
| A+           | \>= 97             |
| A            | 93 - 96.99         |
| A-           | 90 - 92.99         |
| B+           | 87 - 89.99         |
| B            | 83 - 86.99         |
| B-           | 80 - 82.99         |
| C+           | 77 - 79.99         |
| C            | 73 - 76.99         |
| C-           | 70 - 72.99         |
| D+           | 67 - 69.99         |
| D            | 63 - 66.99         |
| D-           | 60 - 62.99         |
| F            | \< 60              |
